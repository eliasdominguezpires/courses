before planning. Read tickets to get ideas on assignments

the mistakes, that you cannot contemplate everything

prioritize, last a sprint (como decir, si no escribir bien las historias o separar en analisis mas pequeños)

The lenght of the spring
The sprint lasts a week
You have to split the sprint/the process into a brief analysis
You split it/divide it into more specific parts


1	- before planning the sprint I try to get general context about the project besides I ask what resources we have (developers assigned)

2 - I avoid interrupting the product owner when he is explaining the requirements except when I have questions

3 - I prioritize the tasks with more complexity
